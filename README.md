# task-manager-app
A repo containing a three-paged React-app for a task-manager. 
Created 11/2024 by Jasu Ahonen

The app will work with a JSON database server at localhost. Can be also used with a dynamic live server, just update the endpoints. 

It had three end-points: /tags, /tasks and /timestamps.

The application is a basic task manager where the user can add tasks and associate tags with them for better clarity. It is also dynamic and configured to work smoothly on small, medium and large screens.

The Home page - consists of displayed tasks alongside corresponding tags. It also shows timestamps how long has a task been active. When the task is ongoing it pulsates green, user can also pause the activity for example for a coffee break. This view can also be used for zeroing out the timers for tasks.

Manage Tasks & Tags - this page is for managing different tasks and tags, creating, deleting and updating new or existing elements in the UI. This will also update the JSON database running in localhost.
